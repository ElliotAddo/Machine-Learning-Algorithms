The data used for this analysis was extracted from the Ghana Stock Exchange for MTN stock prices
Machine learning algorithms were trained and tested on the data set and their performance were evaluated using MSE and other evaluation metrics
This document also contains some unsupervised learning algorithms where I used Hierarchical clustering to anlayze the energy consumption of some states in America
The data used for the clustering was obtained from the SimpliLearn platform
